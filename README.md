PuppyCompare tries to compare 2 sites easily, using puppeteer and node

You need to [install canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas#installation)
| OS | Command |
|-----:|-----------|
|OSX|`brew install pkg-config cairo pango libpng jpeg giflib librsvg pixman`|

You must use node 20

## Use node ^20

```sh
nvm use 20
npm install
```

Before you start, you need to set the client on .env

```sh
TEMPLATE=CLIENT
```

You need to load as json format the different url's that you want to compare into file

```sh
sites/CLIENT.json
```

This "client" is "example"
We need to configure some variables

```sh
[
  {
    "config": {
      "PRODUCTION_URL": "https://example.org",
      "STAGING_URL": "http://example.wpengine.com",
      "COOKIE_PRODUCTION": "example.org",
      "COOKIE_STAGING": "example.wpengine.com",
      "COOKIE_ONE": "",
      "ISCOOKIESET": "false"
    },
    "pages": [
      {
        "id": "001",
        "url": "/"
      },
  }
]
```

Try to DON'T touch the folders

Open a terminal and you can run as:

```sh
node index.js
```

Some folder will be created, and you can find in the src folder all the html generated by the puppenpare

You need to have installed magick
https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php
if you won't make the PDF please comment the next line

```sh
//await ssHtml()
```

New features added:
All the content will be on the folder called 'html_comparative_files'
this will contains the css html images and js required for the index.html
so you can easily will zip this folder and share with your coworkers or add to your task

Once you donwload the zip and unzip, make double click on index.html and will open a tab on your favorite browser
you will be able to chose in the nav on the top right some pages to see any issue on the comparative

Now we are working with:
Node 20
npm 10
puppeteer 22
resemblejs 5
compress-images 2
